# Quick Fix: Pending Transaction Error

## The Error
```
Another transaction is pending. Please complete or cancel it in your Pera Wallet app, then try again.
```

## Quick Fix (3 Steps)

### Step 1: Open Pera Wallet
- **Mobile**: Open the Pera Wallet app on your phone
- **Desktop**: Check the Pera Wallet browser extension or open web.perawallet.app

### Step 2: Complete or Cancel Pending Transaction
- Look for any pending transaction requests in Pera Wallet
- **Approve** the transaction if it's valid, OR
- **Cancel/Reject** the transaction if it's stuck or not needed

### Step 3: Wait and Retry
- Wait 3-5 seconds after completing/cancelling
- Return to the AlgoEase website
- Click "Clear Pending State" button (if shown) or try creating the bounty again

## Why This Happens
Pera Wallet only allows one transaction at a time. If a previous transaction is still pending (waiting for approval), you must complete or cancel it before starting a new transaction.
