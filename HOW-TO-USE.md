## 📋 COMPLETE WORKFLOW

### Step 1: Check Current Status
```bash
python bounty-manager.py
```

You'll see:
```
================================================================================
  📊 CURRENT STATUS
================================================================================

💰 Balances:
   Your Wallet: 9.2960 ALGO
   Escrow:      0.7000 ALGO

📊 Bounty Status: [Shows if there's an active bounty]
```

---

### Step 2: If There's an Existing Bounty

**The manager will tell you:**
```
⚠️  There's already an active bounty!
   Current status: OPEN (or ACCEPTED)

💡 You need to complete the existing bounty first:
   → Accept the bounty (or reject/refund it)
```

**Complete it by:**
- Accepting → Approving → Claiming (happy path)
- OR Rejecting/Refunding (return money)

---

### Step 3: Create New Bounty

**When status shows "Ready to create":**
```
================================================================================

## 💡 TROUBLESHOOTING

### Error: "Transaction rejected"
**Cause:** There's already an active bounty  
**Solution:** Complete the existing bounty first (accept → approve → claim OR reject/refund)

### Error: "Not enough ALGO"
**Cause:** Wallet balance too low  
**Solution:** Get free TestNet ALGO from https://testnet.algoexplorer.io/dispenser

### Typed 'y' but it cancelled
**Cause:** Using old wizard that only accepts "yes"  
**Solution:** Use `python bounty-manager.py` (accepts both y and yes)
