## Overview

Freelancers and clients today face several challenges:

- Trust issues: Clients may hesitate to pay upfront, freelancers fear non‑payment
- High platform fees: Centralized marketplaces charge 5–20% per payment
- Slow payments and manual dispute handling

Solution:

- Trustless escrow via Algorand smart contracts
- Automatic, condition‑based payouts
- Low fees and instant settlement

---

## Features

- Trustless escrow. Funds are locked in a smart contract until conditions are met
- Condition‑based payments. Client approval, DAO vote, or oracle‑verified proof
- Automatic refunds if the deadline passes or work is rejected
- Global and permissionless. Anyone with an Algorand wallet can participate
- Low fees and fast finality on Algorand (~0.001 ALGO per tx)
- Optional arbitration and milestone‑based payouts

---

## How It Works

1. Client creates a bounty
    - Inputs: task description, amount, deadline, optional verifier (client, DAO, oracle)
    - Funds are deposited into a smart contract escrow account
2. Freelancer accepts the task and optionally submits an on‑chain proof/hash
3. Verifier reviews
    - Approve → automatic payout to freelancer
    - Reject or deadline passes → automatic refund to client
4. Contract performs inner transactions and updates state to claimed or refunded
5. Optional escalation via DAO vote or designated arbitrators

## Architecture

### Smart Contract (PyTeal)

Stores bounty metadata:

- Bounty ID
- Client and freelancer addresses
- Amount
- Deadline
- Status (open, approved, claimed, refunded)

Core methods:

- `create_bounty()` — Client creates and funds bounty
- `approve_bounty()` — Verifier approves work
- `claim()` — Freelancer claims funds
- `refund()` — Automatic refund if conditions are not met

### Frontend

- React + Tailwind CSS
- Wallet integration via WalletConnect, Pera, or AlgoSigner
- Views: available bounties, accepted tasks, actions (Approve, Claim, Refund)

### Backend (Optional)

- Node.js or Python for off‑chain metadata, submission storage, and signature helpers

### Blockchain Layer

- Algorand enforces conditions, stores state, and executes releases/refunds
