💼 SCENARIO 1: CREATE BOUNTY (YOUR WALLET → ESCROW)
================================================================================

📊 BEFORE:
   💳 Your Wallet: 100.00 ALGO
   🏦 Escrow:        0.50 ALGO

💸 Creating bounty: 5 ALGO locked

📊 AFTER:
   💳 Your Wallet:  95.00 ALGO  ⬇️ Decreased by 5

✅ YOUR MONEY IS NOW IN ESCROW!
```

```
================================================================================
🏆 SCENARIO 2: WINNER GETS PAID (ESCROW → FREELANCER)
================================================================================

Steps:
1. Freelancer accepts bounty
2. Freelancer completes work
3. Verifier approves quality
4. Freelancer claims payment

📊 BEFORE:
   💼 Freelancer:  10.00 ALGO
   🏦 Escrow:       5.50 ALGO

## 📚 The 6 Functions Explained

### 1. `create_bounty()` - Lock Money in Escrow
**Location:** Lines 78-135 in `algoease_contract.py`

**What it does:**
- Receives your payment (grouped transaction)
- Validates amount > 0
- Validates deadline is in future
- Stores all bounty details in blockchain state
- **Money moves: YOUR WALLET → ESCROW**

**Code Flow:**
```python
1. Assert payment amount matches argument
2. Assert deadline > current time
3. Store client address (you)
4. Store amount (5 ALGO)
5. Store deadline
6. Store task description
7. Store verifier address
8. Set status = OPEN (0)
9. Lock money in escrow ✅
```

---

### 2. `accept_bounty()` - Freelancer Commits
**Location:** Lines 138-155

**What it does:**
- Freelancer says "I'll do this work"
- Records freelancer's address
- Changes status to ACCEPTED
- **No money moves** (just recording commitment)

**Requirements:**
- Status must be OPEN
- Deadline hasn't passed
- Anyone can accept (first come, first served)

---

### 3. `approve_bounty()` - Quality Check
**Location:** Lines 157-173

**What it does:**
- Verifier reviews completed work
- Approves if quality is good
- Changes status to APPROVED
- **No money moves** (just approval signal)

**Requirements:**
- Status must be ACCEPTED
- Only VERIFIER can call this
- This unlocks payment for freelancer

---

### 4. `claim_bounty()` - Winner Gets Paid
**Location:** Lines 175-201

**What it does:**
- Freelancer claims their earned money
- Contract automatically sends payment
- **Money moves: ESCROW → FREELANCER** ✅

**The Magic (Inner Transaction):**
```python
InnerTxnBuilder.Begin()
InnerTxnBuilder.SetFields({
    TxnField.type_enum: TxnType.Payment,
    TxnField.receiver: freelancer_address,
    TxnField.amount: 5_000_000,  # 5 ALGO
    TxnField.sender: escrow_address
})
InnerTxnBuilder.Submit()
# Money automatically transferred!
```

**Requirements:**
- Status must be APPROVED
- Only FREELANCER can call this
- Happens automatically (trustless!)

---

### 5. `refund_bounty()` - Get Money Back
**Location:** Lines 203-235

**What it does:**
- Returns money to client
- Can be called if work is rejected or not done
- **Money moves: ESCROW → YOUR WALLET** ✅

**The Refund (Inner Transaction):**
```python
InnerTxnBuilder.Begin()
InnerTxnBuilder.SetFields({
    TxnField.type_enum: TxnType.Payment,
    TxnField.receiver: client_address,  # YOU
    TxnField.amount: 5_000_000,
    TxnField.sender: escrow_address
})
InnerTxnBuilder.Submit()
# Money automatically returned!
```

**Who can call:**
- Client (you) - Cancel bounty
- Verifier - Reject poor quality work

---

### 6. `auto_refund()` - Deadline Protection
**Location:** Lines 237-264

**What it does:**
- Automatically refunds if deadline passes
- **Money moves: ESCROW → YOUR WALLET** ✅
- **ANYONE can trigger** this (fully trustless!)

**Why it's important:**
- Protects you from stuck money
- Freelancer can't hold money hostage
- Verifier's absence doesn't matter
- Time-based automatic safety

---

## 💰 Money Flow Summary

### The Three Paths:

#### Path 1: Happy Ending (Work Completed)
```
CLIENT WALLET
    │
    │ create_bounty(5 ALGO)
    ▼
  ESCROW (holding 5 ALGO)
    │
    │ claim_bounty()
    ▼
FREELANCER WALLET
    
Result: Freelancer earned 5 ALGO ✅
```

#### Path 2: Refund (Poor Quality / Cancelled)
```
CLIENT WALLET
    │
    │ create_bounty(5 ALGO)
    ▼
  ESCROW (holding 5 ALGO)
    │
    │ refund_bounty()
    ▼
CLIENT WALLET (back)
    
Result: Client got refund ✅
```

#### Path 3: Auto-Refund (Deadline Passed)
```
CLIENT WALLET
    │
    │ create_bounty(5 ALGO)
    ▼
  ESCROW (holding 5 ALGO)
    │
    │ [7 days pass...]
    │ auto_refund()
    ▼
CLIENT WALLET (automatic return)
    
Result: Money never stuck ✅
```

## 🔐 Security Features You Saw

### 1. Grouped Transactions (Atomic)
When creating bounty, these happen together:
- Payment transaction (5 ALGO → escrow)
- App call transaction (bounty details)

Both succeed or both fail. No partial execution!

### 2. Role-Based Access Control
```python
# Only freelancer can claim
Assert(Txn.sender() == FREELANCER_ADDR)

# Only client/verifier can refund
Assert(Or(
    Txn.sender() == CLIENT_ADDR,
    Txn.sender() == VERIFIER_ADDR
))
```

### 3. State Validation
```python
# Can't claim unless approved
Assert(App.globalGet(STATUS) == STATUS_APPROVED)

# Can't refund if already claimed
Assert(App.globalGet(STATUS) != STATUS_CLAIMED)
```

### 4. Inner Transactions (Automatic Payments)
The contract sends money on its own - no human signature needed!

### 5. Immutable Code
```python
def handle_update():
    return Return(Int(0))  # Updates NOT allowed!
```

Once deployed, code can't change. What you see is what you get.

### 6. Deadline Protection
```python
# Auto-refund if deadline passed
Assert(Global.latest_timestamp() >= App.globalGet(DEADLINE))
```

Time-based safety mechanism.

## 💡 Key Takeaways

1. **Escrow is a locked box** - Only code can open it
2. **Money flows automatically** - Based on conditions, not humans
3. **Three possible outcomes:**
   - Winner gets paid (approved & claimed)
   - Client gets refund (cancelled / rejected)
   - Auto-refund (deadline passed)
4. **No trust needed** - Code enforces rules
5. **Transparent** - All transactions on blockchain
6. **Secure** - Multiple protection mechanisms

---

## 🎓 You Now Understand:

- ✅ How smart contracts work
- ✅ How escrow protects both parties
- ✅ How money flows through blockchain
- ✅ PyTeal programming concepts
- ✅ Algorand application architecture

## 📊 Final Demo Results

```
Starting Balances:
  Client:     100.00 ALGO
  Freelancer:  10.00 ALGO
  Escrow:       0.50 ALGO

After Scenario 1 (Create):
  Client:      95.00 ALGO  (-5)
  Escrow:       5.50 ALGO  (+5)

After Scenario 2 (Winner Paid):
  Freelancer:  15.00 ALGO  (+5)
  Escrow:       0.50 ALGO  (-5)

After Scenario 3 (Refund):
  Client:      95.00 ALGO  (+3)
  Escrow:       0.50 ALGO  (-3)

💡 Total money always conserved!
💡 Escrow acted as trustless intermediary!
💡 Both scenarios (winner & refund) work perfectly!
