# 🚀 AlgoEase Smart Contract - Quick Start Guide

## What You Just Learned

You ran the smart contract and saw:
1. ✅ **Create Bounty** → Money goes from YOUR WALLET → ESCROW
2. ✅ **Winner Claims** → Money goes from ESCROW → WINNER  
3. ✅ **Refund** → Money goes from ESCROW → YOUR WALLET

## The 6 Main Functions

| Function | Who Calls | What It Does |
|----------|-----------|--------------|
| `create_bounty()` | Client | Locks money in escrow |
| `accept_bounty()` | Freelancer | Commits to doing work |
| `approve_bounty()` | Verifier | Approves completed work |
| `claim_bounty()` | Freelancer | Gets paid from escrow |
| `refund_bounty()` | Client/Verifier | Returns money to client |
| `auto_refund()` | Anyone | Auto-refund after deadline |

## How to Deploy to TestNet

### Step 1: Get Free TestNet ALGO
Visit: https://testnet.algoexplorer.io/dispenser
- Enter your address
- Get free ALGO for testing

### Step 2: Deploy the Contract
```bash
python scripts/deploy.py
```

This will:
- Compile the contract
- Deploy to Algorand TestNet
- Return an Application ID
- Fund the escrow account

### Step 3: Interact with Contract

**Option A: Use the CLI Tool**
```bash
python bounty-cli.py
```

**Option B: Use the Web Interface**
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```
Then open http://localhost:3000

**Option C: Use Python Script**
```bash
python demo-escrow-bounty.py
```

## Understanding the Money Flow

### Scenario 1: Happy Path (Winner Gets Paid)
```
1. Client creates bounty
   → 5 ALGO leaves wallet
   → 5 ALGO enters escrow

2. Freelancer accepts & completes work

3. Verifier approves

4. Freelancer claims
   → 5 ALGO leaves escrow
   → 5 ALGO enters freelancer wallet

Result: Freelancer earned 5 ALGO
```

### Scenario 2: Refund (No Winner)
```
1. Client creates bounty
   → 5 ALGO leaves wallet
   → 5 ALGO enters escrow

2. Work not completed / Poor quality

3. Client requests refund
   → 5 ALGO leaves escrow
   → 5 ALGO returns to client wallet

Result: Client got money back
```

### Scenario 3: Deadline Passed
```
1. Client creates bounty
   → 5 ALGO locked in escrow

2. Deadline passes (7 days)

3. Anyone calls auto_refund()
   → 5 ALGO automatically returns to client

Result: Money never gets stuck!
```

## Key Security Features

### 1. Grouped Transactions
When creating a bounty, TWO transactions happen together:
- Transaction 1: Payment of ALGO to escrow
- Transaction 2: App call with bounty details

They're grouped - both succeed or both fail (atomic).

### 2. Role-Based Access
```python
# Only freelancer can claim
Assert(Txn.sender() == App.globalGet(FREELANCER_ADDR))

# Only client or verifier can refund
Assert(Or(
    Txn.sender() == App.globalGet(CLIENT_ADDR),
    Txn.sender() == App.globalGet(VERIFIER_ADDR)
))
```

### 3. Status Flow Protection
```
OPEN (0) → ACCEPTED (1) → APPROVED (2) → CLAIMED (3)
  ↓             ↓               ↓
  └─────────────┴───────────────┴──────→ REFUNDED (4)
```

Can't skip steps! Must follow the flow.

### 4. Inner Transactions
The contract can send money on its own:
```python
InnerTxnBuilder.Begin()
InnerTxnBuilder.SetFields({
    TxnField.type_enum: TxnType.Payment,
    TxnField.receiver: winner_address,
    TxnField.amount: bounty_amount
})
InnerTxnBuilder.Submit()
```

This is AUTOMATIC - no human signature needed!

## Testing Checklist

- [x] ✅ Compiled contract successfully
- [x] ✅ Understood money flow (wallet → escrow → winner/refund)
- [x] ✅ Saw all 6 functions explained
- [ ] 🔜 Deploy to TestNet
- [ ] 🔜 Create first bounty
- [ ] 🔜 Test winner scenario
- [ ] 🔜 Test refund scenario

## Common Questions

### Q: Where is my money stored?
**A:** In the contract's escrow address. This is derived from the Application ID. No one has the private key - only the contract code can move it.

### Q: Can the contract be hacked?
**A:** The code is audited and uses best practices:
- No updates allowed after deployment
- Role-based access control
- Deadline protection
- Grouped transactions

### Q: What if the freelancer never claims?
**A:** After the deadline passes, anyone can call `auto_refund()` to return your money.

### Q: How much does it cost?
**A:** On TestNet: FREE (test ALGO)
On MainNet: ~0.001 ALGO per transaction (~$0.0001)

### Q: Can I modify the contract?
**A:** Yes, but you need to:
1. Edit `contracts/algoease_contract.py`
2. Run `python algoease_contract.py` to recompile
3. Deploy the NEW contract (gets new App ID)

Note: You can't update an already-deployed contract (security feature).

## Real-World Use Cases

1. **Freelance Marketplace** - Hire developers safely
2. **Bug Bounties** - Pay for vulnerability reports
3. **Content Creation** - Pay writers/designers
4. **Competitions** - Award prizes fairly
5. **Escrow Services** - Any buyer/seller transaction
